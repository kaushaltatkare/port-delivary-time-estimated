"Port Time Delivery Time Estimated Data Science Project" is a data-driven initiative aimed at optimizing delivery schedules in port logistics. Leveraging advanced data science techniques, this project seeks to predict the estimated delivery time for goods arriving at ports, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and reducing delays. By analyzing historical shipping data, factors such as vessel schedules, weather conditions, port congestion, and cargo handling procedures are considered to generate accurate delivery time estimates. These predictions enable port authorities and shipping companies to better allocate resources, streamline logistics processes, and improve overall supply chain management. Ultimately, the project aims to minimize costs, enhance customer satisfaction, and ensure timely delivery of goods through predictive analytics and data-driven insights.
